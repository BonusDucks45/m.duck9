        <p>Mallard ducks are the most common and recognizable wild ducks in the Northern Hemisphere. You'll find mallard ducks near ponds, marshes, streams, and lakes, where they feed on plants, invertebrates, fish, and insects. Mallards are dabbling, or surface-feeding, ducks because they eat by tipping underwater for food—head down, feet and tail in the air—rather than diving. Mallards also forage and graze for food on land.</p>

        <p>The Peking breed of domestic ducks was bred more than 300 years ago in China and brought to Europe in 1873. Currently widespread in the world and, being highly productive and one of the best meat breeds, it has supplanted many other breeds. 
            Peking ducks have been used to create several other breeds. In Soviet times, Peking and crosses of this breed accounted for more than 90% of the pedigree duck population on collective and state farms. In modern Russia, the main poultry population in large duck farms still belongs to the Peking breed. </p>

    <p>The mulard (or moulard) is a hybrid between two different genera of domestic duck: the domestic Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata domestica) and the domestic duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus), derived from the wild mallard. American Pekins and other domestic ducks are most commonly used to breed mulards due to the breed's high meat production.</p>
